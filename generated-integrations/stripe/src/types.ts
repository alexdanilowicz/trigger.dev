 * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.

 * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
 * 
 * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
 * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
 * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
 * you through the setup process.

 * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
 * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
 * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
 * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
 * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,

 * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
